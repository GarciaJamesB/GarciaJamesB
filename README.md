- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GarciaJamesB
- I created this GitHub repository so showcase how I code in Python.  
- Most of my professional experience has been with C/C++. I've been learning and practicing coding with Python to branch out to areas where using it makes sense.
- If you are reading this file, you've probably received my GitHub link through my resume.  Feel free to browse to see how I code in Python.
